Figure 1.a Ruminococcaceae family abundance over time with repect to baseline %
	Cannot find this figure as same we need to go over and find the 		
	exact figure

Figure 1.b 
	Will need to check
	
Figure 1.c 
	Need to change color for Ruminococcaeae as red.
	Bascially flip the color between Ruminococcea family and
	Rikenellacea
